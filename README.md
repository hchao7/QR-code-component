## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

I learned that it can be very helpful to start out with a CSS reset. I used Josh Comeau's CSS reset, which "undos" certain browser defaults. For example, `box-sizing: content-box` is set to `border-box`, which makes CSS much easier to work with. 

I also learned about the BEM methodology. I know this is a very simple and small project to be applying a methodology to, but since there are so many ways to style a page, I thought following a methodology might guide my planning. 

```css
/* Block */
.card {}

/* Elements */
.card__qr-code {}
.card__heading {}
.card__paragraph {}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I would like more experience with layout-related properties, such as Flexbox. For the project, I only used Flexbox to center a `main` element, which was pretty simple to figure out.

I did use Sass for this project, but my CSS is quite simple, so I did not use it very effectively. I will try to take better advantage of Sass when writing more advanced CSS syntax.

### Useful resources

- [Custom CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me reset the browser default styles.
- [BEM Methodology](https://getbem.com/naming/) - This helped me understand the basics of BEM. Hopefully I applied it correctly!
